      "Summary: Killers of the Flower Moon is a 2023 American epic Western crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Eric Roth, based on the best-selling 2017 non-fiction book Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI by David Grann. Its plot centers on a series of Oklahoma murders in the Osage Nation during the 1920s, committed after oil was discovered on tribal land. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who also serves as an executive producer, alongside Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser, and John Lithgow. It marks the seventh collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio as well as the eleventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro.Development on the film began in March 2016 when Imperative Entertainment won the rights to adapt the book. Scorsese and DiCaprio were attached to the film in 2017, with production initially expected to begin in early 2018. Following several pushbacks and delays in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was scheduled to commence in February 2021 with Apple TV+ now confirmed to finance and distribute the film alongside Paramount Pictures. Principal photography ultimately took place in Osage County and Washington County between the spring and fall of 2021. The film is produced by Scorsese's Sikelia Productions and DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions with its $200 million budget reportedly the largest amount ever spent on a film shot in Oklahoma.Killers of the Flower Moon had its world premiere at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2023, and is scheduled to be released in select cinemas on October 6, 2023, before a wide release in the United States on October 20, 2023 by Paramount Pictures. It is also scheduled for an unspecified streaming release on Apple TV+.\n",
